Sample to build the instance tree outside of the Viewer canvas

## How it works

This sample takes advanyage of the Viewer's [InstanceTree](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Private/InstanceTree/) data to rebuild the model structure outside of Viewer.

This is done with the code from [ExternalTreeExtension.js](./ExternalTreeExtension.js)

This is using [Inspire Tree](http://inspire-tree.com/) to build the UI component.
